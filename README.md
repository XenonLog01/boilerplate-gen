#Boilerplate generator

This is a simple project I've created simply to speed up the development of other projects.
It currently only supports c files, but this is expected to change rapidly. Feel free to 
contribute - every bit helps. We are looking at adding support for kotlin, python, js, ts, 
and many other languages, as well as many different frameworks for them.
